#### You are hosting an web application in EC2, where number of users is expected to increase in comming months. Best methods to add elasticity is:
  * Set up web application on more EC2 instances and set them behind an ELastic Load Balancer.
  * Set up your web application on more EC2 and use Route 53 to route request accordingly.
#### Maximum ratio of IOPS to Volume size is 50:1
  * If the volume size is 8 GiB, the maximum IOPS of the volume can be 400.
#### In different subnet in same VPC, you have 2 Ubuntu instances located. These instances should be able to communicate with each other, but when you try to ping from one instance to another, you get a timeout. The route table seem to be valid and has the entry for the target "local" for your VPC CIDR. The valid reason for this issue is:
  * The Security Group has not been modified to allow the requested traffic.
 #### For more EBS volume curently attached to EC2 instance from one AZ to other.
  * Create a snapshot of the volume and then crate a volume from the snapshot in other AZ.
 #### Retrieve the Pulbic IP addresses assigned to a running instance via the Instance metadata.
  * http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

   * Amazon EC2
   * Amazon ELB
 #### If application is processing once in a week and not all messages are picked by application where application is currently configured on EC2 instance to process msg in SQS. The issue is:
   * Some of message have surpassed the retention period defined for the queue.
   * When you create SQS with default options, the message retention period is 4 days, which means message send at start of week will get deleted before it can be picked by application
   **Queue Attributes**
     * Default Visibility Timeout = 30 sec.
     * Message Retention Period = 4 days.
     * Maximum Message Size = 256KB.
